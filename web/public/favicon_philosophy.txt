The logo represents the intersection of psychology/neuroscience and genetics - which is exactly what SSPsyGene studies:
Visual Elements:

Connected nodes - Represents both:

Neural networks (brain connections in autism/neurodev disorders)
Genetic networks (how genes interact and influence each other)


The curved path - Suggests:

DNA/molecular structures (the biological basis)
Neural pathways (how the brain processes information)
Flowing connections rather than rigid structures (biological systems are dynamic)


Multiple nodes at different positions - Shows:

Complexity - these disorders aren't simple single-gene issues
Network effects - genes and neurons work in interconnected systems
The vertical branch adds depth, suggesting multi-layered interactions


Blue-to-purple gradient - Evokes:

Science and technology (blue is universal for scientific/medical)
Brain/mind (purple often associated with neuroscience/psychology)
The spectrum concept (relevant to autism spectrum disorders)



Core Philosophy:
The logo embodies the idea that understanding neurodevelopmental disorders requires looking at biological networks - not isolated genes or neurons, but how they connect and interact as systems. It's modern, scientific, and suggests the computational/data-driven approach needed to untangle these complex conditions.
