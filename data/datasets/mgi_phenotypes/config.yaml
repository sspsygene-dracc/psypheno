description: |
  The Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) project curates phenotypic annotations for mouse
  mutant alleles, mapping them to standardized mammalian phenotype ontology terms and
  associated genes.

  This table summarizes high-level phenotype information linked to Ensembl mouse genes,
  providing a bridge between genetic perturbations and organism-level phenotypes in the
  mouse model organism.
