longLabel: "Phenotypic brain organoid atlas and biobank for neurodevelopmental disorders"
description: |
  This dataset suite comes from a phenotypic brain organoid atlas and biobank spanning
  neurodevelopmental disorders. It includes patient-level metadata linking individuals
  and their pathogenic variants to brain organoid lines, as well as multiple differential
  expression resources derived from single-cell and pseudobulk analyses.

  The tables capture patient lists, NEBULA-based differential expression at multiple
  FDR thresholds, full gene-level screens, and selected pseudobulk validation genes
  across organoid subclasses, supporting the study of convergent mechanisms in
  neurodevelopmental pathology.
