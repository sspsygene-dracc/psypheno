longLabel: "Massively parallel in vivo Perturb-seq of four transcription factors in developing mouse cortex"
description: |
  This dataset contains results from an in vivo Perturb-seq screen in developing mouse cortex,
  in which four neurodevelopmental transcription factors were systematically perturbed and
  single-cell transcriptomes were profiled across multiple cell types.

  The differential expression (DEG) table captures gene-level changes induced by each
  perturbation within specific cell types, while the cluster-proportion table summarizes
  how individual perturbations shift cell-type and subcluster abundances.
