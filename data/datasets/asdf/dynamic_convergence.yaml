longLabel: "Dynamic convergence of neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene effects across development"
description: |
  This dataset provides a meta-analysis of differential expression effects for
  neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes across multiple perturbations,
  cell types, and developmental stages. It quantifies where and when NDD risk
  genes show convergent transcriptional consequences in the developing brain.

  The META-DEGs table aggregates marker-level statistics, including effect
  sizes and significance measures, enabling integrative analyses of convergent
  trajectories among NDD-associated genes over neurodevelopment.
