longLabel: "CRISPR screening with spatial transcriptomics in zebrafish astrocytes"
description: |
  This dataset originates from a study that combined pooled CRISPR perturbations with
  spatial transcriptomics to interrogate transcriptional circuits in zebrafish astrocytes.
  It reports the effects of individual gene perturbations on spatial gene expression
  patterns and cell states within the brain.

  The table encodes gene-level and perturbation-level statistics, enabling analysis of
  intracellular and intercellular responses to targeted perturbations in a vertebrate
  model system.
