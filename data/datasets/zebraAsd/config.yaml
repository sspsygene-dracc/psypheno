description: |
  This dataset comes from a large-scale in vivo screen that perturbed candidate autism
  spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes in zebrafish and measured phenotypic and molecular
  consequences, focusing on dopaminergic and neuroimmune pathways.

  The table provides sample-level information that can be mapped back to individual
  gene perturbations, supporting analyses of convergence across ASD risk genes in a
  vertebrate whole-organism model.
