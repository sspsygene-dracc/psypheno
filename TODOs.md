- Wranglers update email — effect_column requirement + refreshed
  docs/adding-datasets.md; piggyback on items F.1, F.2 once they land.
  (Internal Colossus; [GH #97])
- At the end, deploy everything to _dev, rerun the preprocessing and
  load-db, and make sure the website looks good and run all tests on the server
  (e2e tests on the dev instance)
- At the end, write a big update email that concisely but completely chunks
  all the features, bug fixes, and updates from my end (Colossus) into a list for
  Catharina and Max, complete with links to the website and where they can see the
  updated results. I'd also like a rough estimate on how many lines were
  added/removed for each feature, plus and overall update on how many LOC were
  added/removed overall through this sprint since Monday.
  - tell wranglers that due to caching, once you hit load-db, the server might
    still serve old data for up to 2 minutes
